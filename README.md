# Part 1. Video #9. (Introduction)

7-segment LED displays are easy to control with an Arduino and a MAX7219 - just 3 wires (plus power supply) and a few lines of simple C++ code.

You don't need to be a rocket scientist to display the numbers 0 thru 9 (and the letters HELP) on a 7-segment LED display unit. So you can display the temperature or distance or... you get the idea!

It's simple so just watch this and follow me through the steps.


# Part 2. Video #10. (Watch Part 1 first).

We complete the sketch from part 1 and display some useful information.

Part 1 (video #9) precedes this one. Watch that first to understand what this video is about!


# Part 3. Video #11. (Watch Parts 1 & 2 first).

We look at good coding techniques to make your code robust and easy to maintain.
